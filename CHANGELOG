0.995
?

0.994
Changed default parameters

0.992
18 jan 2009
added #include <stdio.h> for the newer versions of gcc


0.99
12 april
This is a mostly a public release,
the manual has been updated with the lates improvements.
And some topics that was somewhat obscure has been clarified


0.988 30. march 2009

program will now dump the stripped datasets used in all pair analysis
these are called stripped.* and keep.index.

HMMtest has been somewhat updated such that intarrays and floatmatrix can now be VERY big
using size_t instead of int.

An option in HMMtest to only use snps at specified distances.
like every 2. snp every 3. snp every third snp
Argument is -every INT

EXTRA  9. april 2009
adding -out argument will now generate conform output names

0.987
Many bugfixes
plink reading should work on large datasets,
Futhermore the program should have a somewhat reasonable
If the estimated 'a' is close enough with the alim borders the program will warn

0.985  feb. 8 2009
Theres an error in the plink dokumentation, concerning mapping of non-autosomales chromosomes.
These are mapped as ints not chars. This is fixed

positions are now checked for uniqueness

a bug prevented genotypes datasets with NA's on first 2 loci
   from beeing run in allpairs

0.983
a bug prevented chromosomes higher than 3 to be read from file



0.982
HMMtest has been revamped such that it compiles properly with the mingw compiler. apparantly strsep doesn't exist in mingw.


0.98
Hmmtest 0.73 now included in source dir.
PACKAGE IS NOW CALLED Relate
Futhermore explicit includes are now in every sourcefile
A nice pdf manual describing the method is also included.

0.971
added test files and change some documentation stuff

0.97
added complete support for using plink binary files.


0.961
small bugfix when converting plink bed file.
Reading has also been made more robust.
(checks if values are between 0 and 3)

0.96
Can now run analysis on plink format directly from R.
Program has been made much more user friendly,
Program automaticly chooses fast version when running allpairs
no more need for -choose and -d sets the fast version.
back2 i also by default 2*back.
And cannot be changed

0.95
Apparantly another bug was also introduced, DBL_MAX is not working,
so a preprocessor macro is defined instead SYS_MAX in conf.h
Also a version numbering VERSION is in conf.h


0.94
A bug was introduced in version 0.84, that caused all calculations to be wrong.
it was a hidden typecasting from double to int in ldemmision2_new
This should be fixed from this version.

program can now read plink binary format with getPlink into R,
option to call runHmmld with plink binary has not been implemented yet.


0.93
added queueing for running allpairs/ a joblist
parameter given by -d 

0.92
Added sorting of input data given chromosome (both c/R)


0.91
fixed minor bug if r2=0 among the first 2 SNP
changed stdout so program seems more responsive with larger datasets

0.90
code refactoring
nothing should be changed otherwise

0.89
minor bugfixes
program can now run back=0
program now checks if back>0 when pruning
no more mem leaks


0.881
added possibilty to change back2 from option file
fixed bug preventing running cversion. (no back2 was initialized) 

0.88
fixed more memleaks, espciaccly from R
added posibilty to give a back2 from R,
function call now returns the global mea pba*

0.87
fixed mem-leaks
add an extra back used for runned all pairs

0.86
added possibilty to run fast all pairs.


0.85
added new way of calculating single pair.
This version will make allpairs much faster


0.84
Added support for microsoft visual c++ compiler v.15.00 cl.exe (windows)
added support for intel compiler v.11 icc (windows)



0.83
changed commandline reading so only genotypes and positions are needed.
fixed minor bug, telling the user, that noloci contained non-NA snps
fixed parsing of optionsfile
Alot more usefull output when run from commandline. Especially file IO,
program tells if output filename has changed, because of file existence.

Futhermore the filedumping of the posterier has been changed into 2 case:
if fixk2=0 then only k1 will be dumped
otherwise k1 and k2 will be dumped


0.82
Windows version implemented

0.81
added super all pairs(prerelease) -choose 0 or -choose 1 toggle new/old allpairs
fixed ped/map  via snpMatrix method reading,


0.802
uint to unsigned int

0.801
fixed a bug when trying to allocate non-alloced memory when back=0. These should be no pba's when back=0.

0.80
Added allocation error message. Used if trying to allocate more memory than system has.
More code refactoring.

Started to implement turbo allpairs.
NOT FINISHED yet.

0.77
code clean up.
change hardcoding of eleborate output to runtime option -V int

0.76
gpl added as a license.
small non used functions removed.

0.75
fixed chromosome stripping problem when calling program with pruning.


0.74
changed problem when min=0 was chosen.
refactored the ld calculation subsystem.
fixed parameter calculation
fixed problem concerning optimization when no fix.k and calc.a was chosen

0.73
Implemented a general safeway of reading data.
Implemented viterbi algoritm
Pruning has been completely rewritten
C-version now checks if pair to run analysis is within bounds of dataset.

0.72
Fastpruning now implemented

0.71
both C & R version
Checks if individuals have atleast 1 non-missing loci.
Fixed calculation of kr=k1/2 +k0
C version
Checks if genotype file only contains valid entrys, that s 0...3
If calculate.a and fixk2=0 then force this one-dim to only run-once.

0.70
Now possible to calculate point likelighood


0.69
'The andersfix'
Documentation has been made
